# Work Contracts

Work Contracts are an alternative to traditional task based concurrency (tasks and task queues).  They are designed to be both easy to use and better suited for use in low latency applications.

README is a work in progress.  For details please see the /doc directory of this repo for slides from the CppCon 2024 presentation and "work_contract_fundamentals.pdf" for details.
